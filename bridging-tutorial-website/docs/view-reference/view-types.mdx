There are 3 types of native components that can be used inside React Native application.

### Enhanced React `<View />`

Built-in `<View />` is powerful component that is used in every RN app. However, sometimes we would like to extend it with some new functionality.

:::note

Typical use case:

Create a component with some custom gradient background that should behave like a `<View />` (styling, displaying child views, a11y, etc.)

### Native View

Sometimes RN app needs to access some specific platform component that may not be implemented in React Native core.

:::note

Typical use case:

Bridge a native component like RadioButton, Slider (possibly using some native dependency e.g. Android MaterialComponents)

### Heavy layout (UIViewControllers/Fragments)

Rarely, RN app needs to display some complex native layout, that may be hard/impossible to be embedded inside a native view.
Although, the chance that you will face such challenge is tiny, it's still good to know how to tackle it.

:::note

Typical use case:

Bridge heavy native layout like native listview, or epub reader
