The main purpose of this guide is to show you how to wrap platform APIs in asynchronous methods.
So to simplify the example, the module will be sharing files **only** from application static local assets.
After you complete this guide, you can try to refactor the module to accept the path to any file (e.g. from the documents or cache directory).
