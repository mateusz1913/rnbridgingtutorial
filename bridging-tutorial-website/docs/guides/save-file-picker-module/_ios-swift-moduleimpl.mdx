#### `SaveFilePickerModuleImpl.swift`

Let's start by creating a Swift implementation that will directly call iOS save file picker APIs:

```swift title="ios/SaveFilePickerModuleImpl.swift"
import UIKit

@objc(SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate)
public protocol SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate: AnyObject {
    func onCancel()
    func onError(_ error: Error)
    func onSuccess()
}

/**
 * Native module's shared implementation
 */
@objc(SaveFilePickerModuleImpl)
public class SaveFilePickerModuleImpl : NSObject {
    @objc public weak var delegate: SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate? = nil
    
    static let INVALID_PATH_ERROR_MESSAGE = "Invalid path"
    static let NO_VIEW_CONTROLLER_ERROR_MESSAGE = "No viewcontroller"

    @objc public func saveFileWithFilename(_ filename: String) {
        
    }
}
```

Here, we declare `SaveFilePickerModuleImpl` class together with `SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate` protocol.

<ExportingObjCInfo />

The class will have weak delegate property and one method. For error handling, we also declare 2 static error messages, that will be used later.

For saving file functionality we will use [`UIDocumentPickerViewController`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocumentpickerviewcontroller),
more specifically its [`init(forOpeningContentTypes:asCopy:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocumentpickerviewcontroller/3566733-init) initializer.

And to consume the result from the picker, the Swift class needs to implement [`UIDocumentPickerDelegate`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidocumentpickerdelegate).

```swift title="ios/SaveFilePickerModuleImpl.swift"
/**
 * Native module's shared implementation
 */
@objc(SaveFilePickerModuleImpl)
public class SaveFilePickerModuleImpl : NSObject {
    @objc public weak var delegate: SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate? = nil
    
    static let INVALID_PATH_ERROR_MESSAGE = "Invalid path"
    static let NO_VIEW_CONTROLLER_ERROR_MESSAGE = "No viewcontroller"

    @objc public func saveFileWithFilename(_ filename: String) {
// highlight-start
        let filenameComponents = filename.components(separatedBy: ".")
        guard let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: filenameComponents[0], withExtension: filenameComponents[1]) else {
            let error = SaveFilePickerError.InvalidPath(SaveFilePickerModuleImpl.INVALID_PATH_ERROR_MESSAGE)
            delegate?.onError(error)
            return
        }

        guard let presentedViewController = RCTPresentedViewController() else {
            let error = SaveFilePickerError.NoViewController(SaveFilePickerModuleImpl.NO_VIEW_CONTROLLER_ERROR_MESSAGE)
            delegate?.onError(error)
            return
        }

        let documentPicker = self.createDocumentPicker(with: url)
        documentPicker.delegate = self
        presentedViewController.present(documentPicker, animated: true)
// highlight-end
    }
    
// highlight-start
    private func createDocumentPicker(with url: URL) -> UIDocumentPickerViewController {
        if #available(iOS 14.0, *) {
            return UIDocumentPickerViewController(forExporting: [url], asCopy: true)
        }
        return UIDocumentPickerViewController(url: url, in: .exportToService)
    }
// highlight-end
}

// highlight-start
extension SaveFilePickerModuleImpl : UIDocumentPickerDelegate {
    public func documentPicker(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController, didPickDocumentsAt urls: [URL]) {
        delegate?.onSuccess()
        controller.delegate = nil
    }
    
    public func documentPickerWasCancelled(_ controller: UIDocumentPickerViewController) {
        delegate?.onCancel()
        controller.delegate = nil
    }
}
// highlight-end

// highlight-start
enum SaveFilePickerError: Error {
    case InvalidPath(String)
    case NoViewController(String)
}
// highlight-end
```

First take a look at the `UIDocumentPickerDelegate` implementation - we are implementing two methods, one is returning the urls where the file was saved and the other is called when user cancelled the picker.
In those methods, we have to call `SaveFilePickerModuleDelegate` delegate to communicate success or cancellation.
When it's done, the picker's delegate `controller.delegate` needs to be cleared.

Now we can start implementing `saveFileWithFilename` method.
We begin with getting the URL for the file from local assets based on the `filename` argument.
To do that, we use [`url(forResource:withExtension:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/bundle/1411540-url) on main bundle instance.
If it cannot be obtained, we have to early-return and communicate to the delegate, that there's no such file with that path.
To construct the Error struct we are using custom enum `SaveFilePickerError` defined at the bottom of the file.

Next step is to take currently presented view controller (`RCTPresentedViewController`, that was added to bridging header, is used to grab it) - will use it to modally display the file picker.
As with the url, we also have to do error handling for the case when there's no presented view controller (~0.001% chance, but we should still do it).

Finally, we create the picker and present it modally. To create the picker we are using `createDocumentPicker` helper.
It's because the initializer we want to use is available from iOS 14, but our package declares support down to iOS 13.
To handle it, we are using availability check (`if #available`) to use new initilaizer for iOS 14+ and fall back to old initializer for iOS 13.

When the picker is initialized, we have to set its delegate property to this module instance and present it.
