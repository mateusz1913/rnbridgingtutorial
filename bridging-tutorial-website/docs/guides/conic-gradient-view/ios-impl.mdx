Let's use XCode, to write iOS code. Open XCode, by running this command from the root directory of your app:

```sh
xed ios
```

When workspace is opened, locate `Pods` project and expand it. Search for `Development Pods` and find `ConicGradientPackage` inside. When it's expanded, it will show all files that we created under `conic-gradient-package/ios` directory.

Extending the `<View />` is available only in Objective-C

<IosObjCImpl />

You can check training repo for Objective-C-only implementation [here](https://github.com/mateusz1913/rnbridgingtutorial/tree/main/conic-gradient-package).

That's iOS part, now let's go to [Android](./android-impl)!
