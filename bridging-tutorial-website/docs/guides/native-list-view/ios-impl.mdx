Let's use XCode, to write iOS code. Open XCode, by running this command from the root directory of your app:

```sh
xed ios
```

When workspace is opened, locate `Pods` project and expand it. Search for `Development Pods` and find `NativeListPackage` inside. When it's expanded, it will show all files that we created under `native-list-package/ios` directory.

<Tabs groupId="ios_lang">
<TabItem value="swift" label="ObjC++ & Swift">

<IosSwiftImpl />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="objc" label="ObjC++ only">

<IosObjCImpl />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check training repo for Objective-C & Swift implementation [here](https://github.com/mateusz1913/rnbridgingtutorial/tree/main/native-list-package) and Objective-C-only implementation [here](https://github.com/mateusz1913/rnbridgingtutorial/tree/main/native-list-package-classic).

That's iOS part, now let's go to [Android](./android-impl)!
