#### Add native library as dependency for the package

When developing some native code, you might end up in a need to add some iOS library.
Each RN library that includes some iOS native code is integrated to your project thanks to [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).
And that's also the case for our module - we have `RangeDatePickerPackage.podspec`, so let's navigate there and add a native dependency.

```diff title="RangeDatePickerPackage.podspec"
# `.podspec` file is like "`package.json`" for iOS CocoaPods packages

require "json"

package = JSON.parse(File.read(File.join(__dir__, "package.json")))

# Detect if new arch is enabled
fabric_enabled = ENV['RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED'] == '1'

Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name            = "RangeDatePickerPackage"
  s.version         = package["version"]
  s.summary         = package["description"]
  s.description     = package["description"]
  s.homepage        = package["homepage"]
  s.license         = package["license"]
  s.platforms       = { :ios => "13.0" }
  s.author          = package["author"]
  s.source          = { :git => package["repository"], :tag => "#{s.version}" }

  # This is crucial - declare which files will be included in the package (similar to "files" field in `package.json`)
  s.source_files    = "ios/**/*.{h,m,mm,swift}"
  # Declare dependency (similar to entries under "dependencies" field in `package.json`)
  s.dependency "React-Core"
+
+ s.dependency "Fastis", '~> 2.0'

  # More configuration depending on new or old arch used
  if fabric_enabled
    # Some compiler flags
    folly_compiler_flags = '-DFOLLY_NO_CONFIG -DFOLLY_MOBILE=1 -DFOLLY_USE_LIBCPP=1 -Wno-comma -Wno-shorten-64-to-32'

    s.compiler_flags = folly_compiler_flags + " -DRCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1"
    # XCode flags for new arch
    s.pod_target_xcconfig    = {
      "HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS" => "\"$(PODS_ROOT)/boost\"",
      "OTHER_CPLUSPLUSFLAGS" => "-DFOLLY_NO_CONFIG -DFOLLY_MOBILE=1 -DFOLLY_USE_LIBCPP=1",
      "CLANG_CXX_LANGUAGE_STANDARD" => "c++17",
      "DEFINES_MODULE" => "YES",
      "SWIFT_OBJC_INTERFACE_HEADER_NAME" => "RangeDatePickerPackage-Swift.h",
      # This is handy when we want to detect if new arch is enabled in Swift code
      # and can be used like:
      # #if RANGE_DATE_PICKER_PACKAGE_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED
      # // do sth when new arch is enabled
      # #else
      # // do sth when old arch is enabled
      # #endif
      "OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS" => "-DRANGE_DATE_PICKER_PACKAGE_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED"
    }

    # Dependencies only for new arch
    s.dependency "React-Codegen"
    s.dependency "RCT-Folly"
    s.dependency "RCTRequired"
    s.dependency "RCTTypeSafety"
    s.dependency "ReactCommon/turbomodule/core"
  else
    # XCode flags for old arch
    s.pod_target_xcconfig = {
      "DEFINES_MODULE" => "YES",
      "SWIFT_OBJC_INTERFACE_HEADER_NAME" => "RangeDatePickerPackage-Swift.h"
    }
  end
end
```

For the range date picking we will use [`Fastis` library](https://github.com/simla-tech/Fastis) - it's a Swift library that displays calendar modal that lets the user pick range of dates.
To declare the dependency in the podspec, we add `s.dependency "<name of the native library>"` - in this case it's `s.dependency "Fastis", '~> 2.0'` (`'~> 2.0'` is kind of similar to declaring some JS dependency in package.json with version `"^2"` - so the version needs to be at least `2.0.0`, but less than `3.0.0`).

After that, you can run `npx pod-install` from your app's directory and library should be installed.
