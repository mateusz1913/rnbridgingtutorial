To make Swift elements accessible to Objective-C world, we have to do 4 things:

- make class extending `NSObject`
- mark class and its methods (at least those methods that are meant to be exposed) as public
- mark class with `@objc(exported-objc-name)` decorator
- mark exposed methods with `@objc` decorator
