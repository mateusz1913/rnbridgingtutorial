You can run codegen to generate native classes and interfaces, and also check if specification is defined in correct way:

- on iOS: run `yarn codegen:ios`, the code-generated classes should be available under your app's `<rootDir>/ios/build/generated/ios` directory

- on Android: `yarn codegen:android`, the code-generated classes should be available under the package's `android/build/generated/source/codegen` directory
